## What is Rock Paper Scissors?

It's a hand game played by 2 individuals and consists of number of rounds (We \
have chosen it to be 5). In every round, each player simultaneously forms one \
of three shapes with an outstretched hand (Rock, Paper, Scissors), where Rock \
beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper and Paper beats Rock. The player who \
forms the shape that beats the other's wins the round and adds one point to \
his/her score. If the two players choose the same choice it's a tie and the \
round is re-played. Finally, the the player with highest score after 5 rounds \
is the WINNER!
